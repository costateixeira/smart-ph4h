# WHO SMART GUIDELINES - PH4H

The Pan-American Digital Health Route (PH4H) is an initiative that aims to enable connected health for
all people in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Led by the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB](https://www.iadb.org/en),
the Pan-American Health Organization [PAHO](https://www.paho.org/en) and the countries of the region, this initiative aims to
facilitate the exchange of health data in a secure, efficient and interoperable manner, both within and
between countries, allowing people in the region to share and access their health information. PH4H
promotes regional synergies by maximizing national investments for the exchange of health information.
In addition, PH4H facilitates continuous coordination with regional organizations and networks in digital
health, thus strengthening integration and efficiency in the health sector.

The main goal of PH4H is to deliver better health services to patients regardless of their location.
The project seeks to improve the health care of those who temporarily move for work or other reasons. For
migrants populations, it will enable sharing medical histories, which may improve their opportunities for better employment and
education. In addition, the PH4H will strengthen public health surveillance,
optimize access to limited human resources, and foster research and innovation, resulting in more
efficient public health policies and improved regional economies. As a result, countries will be better
prepared for future pandemics and other health threats. Cross-border use cases that can be
implemented within PH4H are included in this repository.

Unlike a physical route, a PH4H transcends borders, allowing universal access without leaving
anyone behind. The initiative, which will be officially launched at the end of 2024, is supported by the Government of Japan's
Fund for Quality Infrastructure, Disaster Resilience and Health. We look forward to more partners joining us on this transformative journey.
